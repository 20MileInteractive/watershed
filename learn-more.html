				<h2>Water Quality Initiative</h2>

			<div class="columns large-7">
				<p>The Cape Cod Commission has been directed to update the 208 Plan in January of 2013. The Section 208 of the U.S. Clean Water Act was designed to propose implementable solutions for water quality problems from point (direct discharge to surface waters) and non-point (indirect discharge) sources within state-specified geographic regions, including Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This site is the epicenter of information and data the Cape Cod Commission is distributing in this effort. </p>
