Residential lawn loading rates could be reduced on existing developed parcels through an intensive public education/outreach program. Fertilizer loading rates for new development could be accomplished by reducing lot sizes (cluster development), by restricting lawn sizes and/or by incorporating more naturally-vegetated open space areas.  Municipalities could directly reduce fertilizer applications on athletic fields and other properties.  Golf courses can significantly reduce nitrogen loading rates by using slow-release fertilizers and reducing application rates in rough areas.   Cranberry bog fertilizer exports from the bogs can be reduced using tail water recovery systems. ",
